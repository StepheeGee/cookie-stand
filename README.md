## Salmon Cookies

I've created a dynamic webpage for Pat's cookies. A large component of this assignment required me to write JS code to establish a class to model store locations, generates sales data for each location, dynamically builds an HTML table with the specified header and footer, and populates the table with the sales data rows for each store. And now it features a revolving photo carousel.

### Reflections and Comments

How did this go, overall?

Today I made a lot of stylistic changes. I also made sure that my JS code was functional and accurate. I did not manage my time well between assignments today, so I feel like I'm rushing. I've worked on this for about 3 hours and there's more that I want to do, but it will have to wait.   

What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
I didn't know that JS was also responsible in large part for animations. That was new for me. I'm interested in learning what type of animations can be created on a webpage to make it interactive.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? It took me over three hours. But I also started late because I was working on another assignment. I thought it would take me longer to do this. And it probably should've. But now it's late at night.
