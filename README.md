I really don't know what I'm doing here. But I know what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to create JS Object literals for each shop location that Pat owns. I assigned properties to each object. And then I organized and structured the data for each location. Then, I used the objects to calculate and render sales data (in the sales.html document) by using two functions, respectively, caculateSales and renderSales.

### Reflections and Comments

What just happened over the weekend? I felt like I was keeping up with the instruction until today. Today threw me for a loop. I'm having the most difficulty with having multiple html documents that rely on one javascript document. I finally decided to comment out the script tag on my index.html file, until I can figure out how to synchronize everything.

Today was really challenging. And not in an inspiring way. In a way that felt like mental gymnastics torture. 

I'm frustrated with myself because I created all these objects and properties, but I did not use any methods. Instead, I used functions to perform the calculations that I needed. And I think I need to go back tomorrow and refactor my code to create objects with methods and then define the functions within the method. I think that's where I messed up. But I can't even think straight anymore this Monday evening.
